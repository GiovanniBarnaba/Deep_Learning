# Deep_Learning Project: **Land-Use Scene Classification**
🌍 Satellite Image Classification

Explore the world from above! 🛰️

Discover and classify satellite images from a diverse dataset of 21 unique categories. With 500 high-resolution images per class, each boasting a pixel-perfect 256x256 resolution, you'll dive deep into the world of Earth's pixelated beauty.

📸 Dataset Details:
- 21 Fascinating Categories
- 500 Images per Category
- Stunning 256x256 Pixel Artistry
- Ground Truth: 1 Foot per Pixel

Our mission? Harness the power of neural networks! Join us as we journey through various neural architectures, striving to master the art of satellite image classification. 🚀🧠
