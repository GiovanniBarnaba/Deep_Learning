# Deep_Learning Project: **Land-Use Scene Classification**
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available at the following link ()
it is composed by 500 images for each of the 21 classes and the original size of the images is 256x256 pixels.
All the images are characterized by the pixel resolution of 1 foot.
The aim of the project is to train a neural network in order to correctly classify the satellite images.
